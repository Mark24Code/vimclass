=======================================================


Open files in tabs:                                   vim -p file1 file2 file3

Change to different tab:                              Ctl-PgDn or Ctl-PgUp
    in normal mode:                                   gt (next tab) gT (previous tab)
	go to tab in position {i}                         {i}gt


:tabedit {file}  (tabe, tabn[ew])                     edit {file} in new tab
:tabfind {file}  (tabf)                               open new {file} in new tab with {path/to/file}
:tabclose      (tabc)                                 close current tab
:tabclose {i}  (tabc {i})                             close i-th tab
:tabonly (tabo)                                       close all tabs except current tab


:tab ball                           show each buffer in new tab (up to 'tabpagemax' tabs)
:tab help                           open new help window in its own tab page
:tab drop {file}                    open {file} in new tab or jump to tab with {file} if already open
:tab split                          copy current window to a new tab of its own

:sp myfile.txt                      creates a new window in current tab editing myfile.txt.  That window
                                    can be *moved* to a new tab by pressing ^W T
:vsp myfile.txt                     same as above but for vertical split

:tab sp                             split current window but open split in new tab

^Wc                                 close current window. if this window is last window in tab,
                                    tab closes too.
