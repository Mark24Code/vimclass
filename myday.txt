                                      MY DAY

Today I was working on my React Capstone for Thinkful bootcamp.  In particular, I was doing 
server side testing.  I needed to get the /userdata endpoint working, and I think I accomplished
that.  I got started on expanding the functionality of the /questions endpoint, and now all
the basic CRUD functionality works, except that I need to drill down on the PUT methods
and allow updating of sub-sub objects.  I'll probably do that tomorrow.

I've been working on following my diet and doing back exercises each day.  Also I'm riding my 
bike, so I'm burning extra calories.  Hopefully I'll be weighing less by this time next week
and a lot less by this time next year.

Then to top it all off, I started work on this vim class.  I should create a github repo for it 
so I can work on it from any of my computers.  That would be helpful.  I'll get started on that
after this current lesson and assignment.
