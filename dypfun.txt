This is just me playing around with DYP and registers


Take this line and yank it into register "t".


Move this half to the first half of the line. Second half of this line.  


Then undo that change.  Paste the resulting line below.  Then copy a redo of that into
register "r" and paste it below the '+++' line.

Undo: 
Second half of this line.  Move this half to the first half of the line.

++++++++++++++++++++

Redo:
Move this half to the first half of the line. Second half of this line.  


Okay, paste a listing of your registers below:

""   Move this half to the first half of the line. Second half of this line.  ^J
"0   TODO^J
"1   TWO)^J
"2   Delete this^J
"3   Delete this^J
"4   Delete this^J
"5   Delete this^J
"6   Delete this^J
"7   Delete this^J
"8   Delete this^J
"9   Delete this^J
"a   Append this line to the b register.^JAppend this line to the a register.^JAppend this line to the b register.
"b   Zebra <= Cut this word into the z register.^J
"f   Yank this line into the "f register.^JAppend this line to the "f register.^J
"h   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------^J
"j   Yank this line into the "j register.^JAppend this line to the "j register.^J
"r   Move this half to the first half of the line. Second half of this line.  ^J
"u   Second half of this line.  Move this half to the first half of the line.^J
"z   Zebra
"-   Move this half to the first half of the line.
"*   ${RANDOM}
"+   ${RANDOM}
".   ^@^@Okay, paste a listing of your registers below:^@^@
"%   dypfun.txt
"/   Delete this
"=   AutoPairsReturn()

NOTE: I used the terminal's cut and paste to do this!  But I also had to :set paste in vim.

I wonder if there's a way to "put" a listing of all registers into the document?

Copy this line into register "x"

Copy this line into register "y"


Append this line into register "x"


Append this line into register "y"


Paste contents of register "y" on this line:  Copy this line into register "y" Append this line into register "y"


Paste contents of register "x" bellow this line.
Copy this line into register "x"
Append this line into register "x"



Okay, now you can go...unless there's anything else cute you can think of!?!?
